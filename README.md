# Guided Project: GitHub Copilot with Python

## Creating Text Games

1. Excercise

Develop a console-based Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock game in Python.
  The game is known from the sitcom "Big bang theory".
  Use GitHub Copilot with following comment-prompt:

  ``` markdown
  # TODO: Develop a console-based Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock game in Python
  # Game should be modular, allowing for easy updates or rule changes
  # Implement game rules:
  # - Scissors decapitate lizard
  # - Scissors cuts paper
  # - Paper covers rock
  # - Rock crushes lizard
  # - Lizard poisons Spock
  # - Spock smashes scissors
  # - Lizard eats paper
  # - Paper disproves Spock
  # - Spock vaporizes rock
  # - Rock crushes scissors
  # Include user input for selecting options and display game results
  # Ask user if they want to play again
  # If user selects 'yes', repeat the game
  # If user selects 'no', exit the game
  ```

2. Practice task

  Develop a console-based Rock Paper Scissors game in Python.
  Use your own GitHub Copilot comment-prompt. My prompt was:

  ``` markdown
  # TODO: Develop a console-based Rock Paper Scissors game in Python
  # Game should be modular, allowing for easy updates or rule changes
  # Implement game rules:
  # - Rock crushes scissors
  # - Scissors cuts paper
  # - Paper covers rock
  # Include user input for selecting options and display game results
  # Ask user to select an option and display the result
  # Ask user if they want to play again
  # If user selects 'yes', repeat the game
  # If user selects 'no', exit the game
  ```
